## Visibility test

### Pre-requisites

Below is the list of all the elements that will be needed prior to the test:

1. Have access to `yarn` on your computer (**important**: make sure that you are not using `npm`)
2. Use the latest version of Node
3. Being able to clone or download this repository on your computer
4. Having visited https://algolia-ui-library.netlify.app/ in order to understand how our components work

### The test

You will need to re-implement the page from the folder `mockups` using our UI library.

You will find below some details about the test:

- **The code should be written using TypeScript**, as much as possible.
- One of the sections should have the ability to switch themes when clicking on the button (see mockups for more details).
- Some components should make use of icons. We suggest that you use the react-feather library for that.
- All images can be taken from https://placeholder.com/
- **Bonus points** if you add your personal touch to the page (it can be CSS animations, custom components, new interactions... Just be creative!)

Once you're done, please upload the assignment to a GitHub repository and send the link to visibility-squad@algolia.com so that the team can review.

Good luck,

The Visibility team
